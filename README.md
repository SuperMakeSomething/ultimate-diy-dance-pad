Code + design files for the ultimate DIY dance pad project featured in Super Make Something episode 26!

A few years ago, [I built my own Dance Dance Revolution gamepad](https://youtu.be/nXjj9IXUaA4?feature=shared). While it was a huge improvement over the soft pads that came bundled with the game, it still had two major problems that became obvious over time:
- It didn't have a bar, making it hard to play difficult songs.
- It was still too light and could slide all over the place during heavy play.

To fix this, I'm revisiting this project and am building the ultimate dance pad. Project progress is being documented through [a set of build vlogs on YouTube Shorts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoOBpWROi9Q&list=PLZtsEimHCFkJZeqKqxmGUpDML9EhFMFjj), as well as a _full project_ video that will release once the build is complete. 

This repository will contain links to everything you need to build your own dance pad, as well as design files, and code so that you can create your ultimate "Dance Dance Revolution" or "Pump It Up!" game controller.

## Dance Pad Frame Design
Bill of materials and more information coming soon!  In the meantime, more information about this part of the build can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEakltDodVs&list=PLZtsEimHCFkJZeqKqxmGUpDML9EhFMFjj&index=2) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_3n6E3e8bk&list=PLZtsEimHCFkJZeqKqxmGUpDML9EhFMFjj&index=5).

## Dance Pad Circuit Board Design
I created a custom circuit board for this design that can be purchased now on PCBWay.com! The board supports up to five arrow panels for both "Dance Dance Revolution" and "Pump It Up!" builds and is compatible with [both arcade sensors and force sensitive resistors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7CdXCQt7WU&list=PLZtsEimHCFkJZeqKqxmGUpDML9EhFMFjj&index=3).  The board also supports Neopixels for each arrow panel, which can be powered both via USB (if the build only has a few Neopixels) or via external power (if the build has a LOT of lights)!  The circuit board is designed around the Raspberry Pi Pico and runs Circuit Python, so that everything can be easily reprogrammed with nothing more than a text editor! (No software installs required!)  

Two circuit board files are available for this project:
- A panelized PCB that contains both the main PCB and four arrow panel breakout boards.
- Individual arrow panels in case you want to build a "Pump It Up!" dance pad.

PCB design files and code will be posted here soon, but in the meantime you can purchase the panelized PCB and additional arrow breakout boards at the following links if you can't wait to get started!
- LINKS COMING SOON!
